            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p n="1">1. The <hi>Lion,</hi> which is the <hi>King</hi> of all the Beaſts of the field.</p>

            <p>Thirdly, Here is <hi>Religion,</hi> and the <hi>beſt</hi> of all Religions, the <hi>Chriſtian Religion,</hi> moſt amply, though <hi>enigmatically</hi> and myſtically, ſet forth unto us; for,</p>
            <pb n="3" facs="tcp:100152:9"/>
            <p n="1">1.

            <p n="2">2. His <hi>humane nature</hi> is noted unto us, by <hi>him</hi> that had the face and appearance of <hi>a man.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And as his <hi>natures</hi> and the <hi>quality</hi> of his perſon are here thus <hi>myſtically</hi> expreſt; ſo his <hi>offices,</hi> that he was to diſcharge, are here likewiſe in the <hi>ſame manner,</hi> of the <hi>Egyptian</hi> Hiero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glyphicks, ſet forth unto us; as.</p>
            <p n="1">1. His <hi>Regal</hi> and Kingly office, whereby he was to <hi>rule</hi> and govern his Church, is here to be underſtood by the <hi>Lion,</hi> which is the <hi>King</hi> of all the Beaſts.</p>
            <p n="2">2. His <hi>Prieſtly</hi> office, whereby he was to <hi>teach</hi> and to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct his people, and to offer <hi>ſacrifice</hi> unto God, to appeaſe his <hi>wrath</hi> and ſo to take away the <hi>ſin</hi> of the world, is here moſt aptly expreſt by the Oxe or Calfe, that was deemed the <hi>moſt acceptable ſacrifice,</hi> that could be offered unto God:
<note place="margin">Num. 23.1.</note> as you may ſee by the ſacrifice of <hi>Balaam.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And, as his <hi>natures</hi> and his <hi>offices</hi> are here <hi>thus</hi> to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood; ſo the <hi>chiefeſt</hi> things that he was to do, and the <hi>chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt</hi> points that we are to <hi>believe,</hi> are likewiſe here fairly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſt under what is ſignified by theſe <hi>four Beaſts;</hi> as,

            <p>Fourthly and laſtly, not onely the foreſaid <hi>particulars</hi> concerning Chriſt and theſe <hi>main</hi> points of Chriſtian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion are hereby to be obſerved, but alſo all the <hi>whole duty</hi> of man, and the <hi>chiefeſt points</hi> that every Chriſtian ought to <hi>diſcharge,</hi> if he looks for eternal happineſs, are here expreſt unto us, under the <hi>qualities, conditions, deſcription,</hi> and <hi>pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice</hi> of theſe Beaſts, as hereafter I ſhall more <hi>fully</hi> declare unto you.</p>

            <p>And ſo you ſee, here is <hi>ſententia brevis,</hi> a ſhort ſpeech, but <hi>materia uberrima,</hi> an Ocean of matter to ſail over.

            <p>So the <hi>four Evangeliſts</hi> in <hi>general</hi> aimed at the <hi>ſame thing,</hi> to ſet forth the <hi>life</hi> and <hi>death</hi> of the <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> and to bring us all to <hi>believe,</hi> that <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> is the <hi>Son of God,</hi> the <hi>Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our</hi> of the world; and that in <hi>believing</hi> on him, we ſhall have <hi>eternal life.</hi>

And yet the <hi>Seraphims</hi> that ſtand in the <hi>preſence</hi> of God are fain to cover their <hi>faces,</hi> not to hide their ſins which they had not, but becauſe they are not able to behold the <hi>brightneſs</hi> of Gods glorious <hi>Majeſty;</hi> and if the <hi>Angels</hi> hid their <hi>faces</hi> from the <hi>brightneſs</hi> of Gods Glory, how dares <hi>ſinfull man</hi> prie into it? becauſe, as the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>he dwels in the

               <note place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.12.</note> like the beholding of a man <hi>ſuddenly</hi> paſſing by us, when we can look upon <hi>nothing</hi> but onely his back parts, it is impoſſible for <hi>any</hi> man in this <hi>mortality</hi> to know perfectly and exactly the <hi>being</hi> and <hi>wayes</hi> of the moſt higheſt.</p>

            <p>And therefore the <hi>ſubtle Serpent</hi> that aymed at the <hi>readieſt</hi> way to deſtroy them, promiſed unto <hi>Eva</hi> (and he kept his promiſe) that if they would eat of the <hi>tree of knowledge,</hi> their eyes <hi>ſhould be opened</hi> and they ſhould be as <hi>Gods,</hi> knowing <hi>good and evil,</hi> and ſo it was; for the text ſaith, that <hi>their eyes were opened,</hi> and they had the knowledge both <hi>of good and evil,</hi> the good that they had <hi>loſt,</hi> and the evil that they had <hi>fallen into;</hi> for they knew <hi>that they were naked.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And ſo <hi>this knowledge</hi> did but direct them a way to <hi>run a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way</hi> from God, and teach them the <hi>art</hi> to ſowe fig-leaves <hi>to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,</hi> to cover their <hi>ſhame,</hi> and to hide their wickedneſs and themſelves from the <hi>ſight</hi> of God, which they could never do: And therefore happy <hi>Adam</hi> hadſt thou been if thou never hadſt had this knowledge, for this knowledge made thee to <hi>fall;</hi> and ſo the Prophet <hi>Eſay</hi> ſaith of <hi>Babylon,

            <q>Ingenio perii qui miſer ipſe meo.</q>
            <p>My wit and my knowledge hath <hi>undone</hi> me.

            <p>And therefore the Devil could <hi>wiſh</hi> that all his ſervants were as knowing as <hi>Berengarius,</hi> and as ſubtle as <hi>Duns Scotus;</hi> becauſe he hath more excellent <hi>execrable</hi> ſervice from one of them, then he can have from a thouſand others: for it is a true ſaying, <hi>That inferiour conceits have inferiour ſins, &amp; non niſi ex magnis ingeniis magni errores,</hi> and the great er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors never came but from <hi>great wits,</hi> ſuch as <hi>Arius, Pelagius,</hi> and the reſt of the great <hi>Hereticks</hi> had.

And therefore the Prophet <hi>David</hi> compareth the government of the unruly people, to the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peaſing of the <hi>raging ſeas,</hi> ſaying unto God, <hi>Thou ſtilleſt the rage of the ſea,

And ſo we are no
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:100152:31"/>wayes able to ſtand and to <hi>juſtifie</hi> our ſelves in the ſight of God: for we are all become <hi>abominable,</hi> and there is none <hi>that doth good, no not one,</hi> But in all men there is <hi>corruption,</hi> in the beſt men there is <hi>defection,</hi>
               <note place="margin">What the beſt of all our acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous are.</note> and in the Angels <hi>unfaithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> hath been found.</p>
            <p>And therefore God hath ſhut up all <hi>in unbelief,</hi> that every mouth ſhould be <hi>ſtopped,</hi> and all the world <hi>culpable</hi> before God; for if you looke into <hi>the beſt</hi> of all our actions, and the <hi>choiceſt</hi> wayes that we walk in, you ſhall find that the <hi>righteouſneſs</hi> which we have by <hi>nature,</hi> is but <hi>juſtitia Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilium, splendida peccata,</hi> as Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> calls them: or the <hi>wiſedome</hi> of the <hi>fleſh,</hi> not ſanctified by faith, as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> calls it. The <hi>righteouſneſs</hi> that we have by the <hi>Law</hi> is but <hi>juſtitia Phariſaeorum,</hi> which as Saint <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> ſaith, was <hi>in oſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatione non in rectitudine intentionis, in locutione non in opere, in corporis afflictione non in mandatorum obſervatione,</hi> and ſo it was but <hi>ſceria obducta,</hi> ſin guilded and <hi>unprofitable,</hi> becauſe never perfectly performed, no not by the <hi>ſtricteſt</hi> Phariſee.

            <p>And therefore we ſhould never <hi>exalt</hi> our ſelves with high conceits of our <hi>own worth,</hi> like the <hi>proud Phariſee;</hi> but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther fall down upon our knees with the <hi>humble Publican,</hi> and ſay, Lord <hi>be merciful unto me a ſinner:</hi> and to cry out with the Prodigal Child, <hi>we have ſinned againſt Heaven and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt thee, and we are no more worthy to be called thy Sons.</hi> For if God ſhould enter into judgement, and be <hi>extream</hi> to mark what we do amiſs, <hi>O Lord, who could abide it?</hi> For no fleſh living could be <hi>juſtified.</hi>
               <note place="margin">That we ought not to hide and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver our ſins.</note> And therefore we ſhould not ſtand to <hi>juſtifie</hi> our ſelves and our <hi>wayes</hi> before God, but rather with theſe <hi>Beaſts</hi> and thoſe <hi>holy Cherubims</hi> to cover our <hi>feet with two of their wings.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But by this <hi>covering</hi> of our <hi>feet,</hi> we muſt not underſtand the <hi>hiding</hi> and covering of our <hi>ſins,</hi> as moſt of us uſe to do; for <hi>Solomon</hi> tells you plainly that he <hi>which hideth his ſins ſhall

               <note place="margin">

            <p>And therefore though we ought to <hi>cover our feet,</hi> that is, not to <hi>juſtifie</hi> our wayes before God: yet we muſt not <hi>cover our ſins,</hi> but confeſs them with an <hi>humble, lowly, penitent and obedient heart,</hi> if ever we look to obtain <hi>forgiveneſs</hi> of the ſame.</p>

            <p>So we ſhould all be <hi>ſwift</hi> to hear, and <hi>diligent</hi> to do our duties; not lazily to go about them, like the <hi>Snaile,</hi> of whom the Poets fain, that when <hi>Jupiter</hi> invited his Creatures un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his Feaſt, the Snail came laſt of all, which admoniſheth us, ſaith <hi>Alciat.</hi>

            <p>And as we ought to uſe <hi>diligence</hi> in all that we take in hand; ſo we ought more ſpecially to uſe it in the <hi>ſervice</hi> of God, and to go to our Saviour Chriſt, that bids his <hi>Church</hi> and every <hi>member</hi> of his Church <hi>to make haſt,</hi> or to <hi>flie away,</hi> as the original word imports, and to be like <hi>to a Roe, or to a young Hart upon the mountaines of ſpices,</hi> where ſhe runneth and <hi>skippeth</hi> for very <hi>haſte</hi> to get away: ſo <hi>Abraham</hi> made <hi>haſte</hi> to make <hi>proviſion</hi> for the Angels that came unto him; and ſo <hi>David</hi> ſaith, <hi>O God, thou art my God, early will I ſeek thee:</hi> and ſo the women that ſought Chriſt <hi>came early, while it was yet dark,</hi> unto the Sepulchre.</p>

            </p>
            <p>For you may ſee the <hi>Citizens</hi> of this World, how diligent they are and ſpare <hi>no coſt</hi> to repair and beautifie their <hi>own houſes</hi> in the faireſt manner; and how <hi>ſlow</hi> they are, and how <hi>backward</hi> to do any thing to ſet up the <hi>houſes of God</hi> upon their feet.

            <p>For ſo you ſee how <hi>Judas</hi> watched and walked unto the High Prieſts, and from the <hi>High Prieſts</hi> to the <hi>Garden,</hi> and from the <hi>Garden</hi> to the High Prieſts again, and from the High-Prieſts to the <hi>gallowes,</hi> and moſt of this while Saint <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> and the reſt of the Diſciples ſlumbered and ſlept.</p>
            <p>But the reaſon why we are ſo <hi>ſlow</hi> in our <hi>flight</hi> towards heaven, is, becauſe our wings that ſhould carry us, are <hi>bird<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lim'd</hi> and entangled with abundance of cares about worldly wealth, or <hi>drowned</hi> in the vain delights of ſinful pleaſures, or <hi>preſſed</hi> down with the weight of thoſe vanities, whereof the leaſt is <hi>heavy enough</hi> to ſink a ſhip; that being <hi>burdened</hi> with ſuch hinderances, and hindered with ſuch burdens, we cannot ſerve God with that <hi>readineſs</hi> as we ought to do.

            <p>And therefore,
<note place="margin">What hinder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth our readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to ſerve God, and our diligence in his ſervice.</note> as we ſee the <hi>birds</hi> that flie, will carry no more <hi>weight</hi> upon their backs, but what neceſſity doth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire: And as the runners of a race, will eaſe themſelves of all <hi>heavy burdens;</hi> ſo we being to flie up to Heaven, and to run our <hi>race</hi> towards the ſpiritual <hi>Canaan,</hi> ſhould caſt away both <hi>deliciarum putredinens &amp; curarum magnitudinem,</hi> our worldly <hi>cares</hi> and our ſinful delights, and all other things that may <hi>hinder</hi> us to run <hi>readily</hi> to do the Lords ſervice, and to flie with the <hi>Cherubims</hi> and theſe <hi>Beaſts,</hi> about the Lords affairs.</p>
            <p>Which if we do, we ſhall be crowned not with a <hi>garland</hi> of ſlowers, as the <hi>Romans</hi> uſed, but with a crown of <hi>eternal
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:100152:33"/>glory,</hi> as the Apoſtle ſpeaketh. And if this cannot allure us to be <hi>ready</hi> and diligent in Gods ſervice, but ſtill to load our ſelves with the <hi>garbages</hi> of the earth; then I muſt turn from the Apoſtles <hi>promiſe</hi> to the Prophets <hi>threatning,</hi> and ſay,

            <p>But for the trial of the <hi>truth</hi> hereof, his Majeſty hath <hi>moſt graciouſly</hi> appointed, and his Grace here doth moſt <hi>favoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly</hi> countenance theſe <hi>wiſe</hi> and <hi>religious</hi> men that ſhall <hi>justly</hi> and <hi>religiouſly</hi> determine theſe things.

So the wiſeſt men conceived that they ought not to <hi>countenance</hi> and favour thoſe that had been <hi>Traytors</hi> unto other Princes; though they had done good ſervice unto them: and that for theſe three reaſons.</p>
            <p n="1">1.

            <p n="2">2. For that this <hi>honouring</hi> and <hi>magnifying</hi> of Rebels and Traytors to <hi>former Princes,</hi> for their good ſervice done to <hi>latter Maſters,</hi> may prove to be an <hi>encouragement</hi> for others to become Rebels and Traytors in like manner againſt their Kings. For when amongſt <hi>many</hi> thouſands of Rebels, they ſee but <hi>few</hi> puniſhed, the <hi>reſt</hi> pardoned, and many of them <hi>fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured</hi> and <hi>preferred,</hi> why may not the <hi>ſeditious</hi> think, that

            <p n="3">3. For that this favouring and countenancing of thoſe that <hi>have been</hi> Rebels and falſe, is a great offence and <hi>diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement</hi> to thoſe that have ever continued ſaithful and loyal, eſpecially if they ſee themſelves poſtponed and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glected.</p>
            <p>And therefore the <hi>Kings</hi> and <hi>Princes</hi> that I told you of, thought it neither <hi>wiſdom</hi> nor <hi>policy</hi> to regard and favour thoſe, whom they <hi>pardoned</hi> for their <hi>treachery</hi> to their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Princes, though they had done never ſo <hi>good ſervice</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to themſelves; and if all Kings did ſo, I believe <hi>fewer</hi> Tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors would ſpring up among the people.</p>
            <p>And this appeareth <hi>plainly</hi> by our new <hi>Plotters</hi> of <hi>Rebellions</hi> and <hi>Treaſons</hi> now amongſt us in this Kingdom of <hi>Ireland;</hi> for <hi>who</hi> and <hi>what</hi> are they that <hi>doe thus</hi> murmur and mutter a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt both <hi>God</hi> and his <hi>Anointed,</hi> the King and his Lieutenant, the Church and Common-wealth?

            </p>
            <p>And what <hi>wayes</hi> do they take for this, but the very ſame which they had <hi>learned</hi> and <hi>practiſed</hi> before in <hi>England</hi> under the <hi>Long-Parliament.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. To <hi>tax</hi> and to <hi>traduce</hi> the <hi>good King</hi> for doing that they know not, nor ever ſhall be able to prove that he did; but the <hi>Scots</hi> ſay that he did: and ſo they do ſay a <hi>thouſand things</hi> more then I <hi>believe</hi> to be true: and they ſhould believe <hi>nothing,</hi> e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially what they <hi>know not,</hi> againſt their King, when as <hi>all</hi> other men, that are both <hi>wiſe</hi> and <hi>honeſt,</hi> can <hi>ſufficiently</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer and juſtifie all that ever his now Majeſty did.

            <p>Therefore theſe very <hi>firebrands</hi> of ſedition, knowing this, would a little excuſe his Majeſty, by laying the faults upon his <hi>Counſellors,</hi> that ſeduced him. And who are they? They ſpeak in general, <hi>&amp; in univerſalibus latet error;</hi> ſo did the <hi>long Parliament</hi> againſt our late King: there they learned their <hi>leſſon,</hi> and they walk in the ſame paths. But the former <hi>Parliaments</hi> could name their names, the <hi>Duke of Bucking<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham:</hi> ſo can <hi>theſe men</hi> name the <hi>Duke of Ormond.</hi> And what hath he done? I obſerve two things that they charge him with.</p>
            <p n="1">1. To <hi>teſtifie</hi> what he knew to be <hi>truth,</hi> and theſe men con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived to be otherwiſe; A <hi>mighty</hi> fault! becauſe they had not their eyes <hi>open</hi> to ſee the truth, his <hi>Grace</hi> offended to <hi>teſtifie</hi> the truth.</p>
            <p n="2">2. In obeying his Majeſty's <hi>gracious goodneſs,</hi> by <hi>relieving</hi> thoſe that were <hi>neceſſitous,</hi> and perhaps, for ought that they know, had done his Majeſty <hi>very good ſervice,</hi> and, for ought that we know, had done no <hi>injury</hi> to any of our men; and this is a ſin <hi>unpardonable</hi> with theſe <hi>uncharitable</hi> men. I, but
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:100152:50"/>they will ſay, by relieving <hi>theſe</hi> he lets the <hi>Army</hi> ſtarve: and I demand, what <hi>Subject</hi> ever did pawn his own <hi>lands,</hi> melt his own <hi>plate,</hi> lay out his own <hi>moneys</hi> to relieve the King's <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,</hi> and to ſhew himſelf, I will not ſay <hi>more faithful,</hi> but I ſay, <hi>neer ſo faithful</hi> to his King, and ſo bountiful a bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factor and friend <hi>to all the King's loyal Subjects,</hi> as the <hi>Duke of Ormend</hi> hath alwayes been? I muſt, and ever will, with all thankfulneſs acknowledge it; when the <hi>long Parliament</hi> and their <hi>whelps</hi> had robbed me of all that I had, all the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief and ſubſiſtence, which I had from <hi>all the friends</hi> in the world, was that <hi>bountiful gift,</hi> which this <hi>noble Duke</hi> ſent me by Sir <hi>George Lane:</hi> And I could name <hi>the many many more,</hi> to whom his <hi>Grace</hi> did the like; And are theſe things, faults worthy to be reproved? And I am ſure he hated the <hi>Rebellion,</hi> and diſowned the <hi>Rebels</hi> of this Nation as much or more then any man: and would you have him to be an enemy to the <hi>poſtnati,</hi> and a ſtranger to the <hi>innocent?</hi> God hath made him a more <hi>honourable,</hi> and a more <hi>gracious</hi> man.</p>
            <p>I, but we are not yet come to the <hi>quick,</hi> the <hi>Engliſh inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt,</hi> by the favour of the <hi>Duke</hi> unto the <hi>Iriſh</hi> and the <hi>Judges</hi> of the Court of <hi>Claim,</hi> is much <hi>ſhaken,</hi> and is like to be <hi>diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred</hi> and left inanimate.</p>
            <p>But would you have the <hi>Engliſh intereſt</hi> to continue, be it <hi>right</hi> or <hi>wrong?</hi> or would you have it <hi>ſo</hi> to continue, that God might <hi>bleſs</hi> it, and it to <hi>proſper?</hi> If ſo, then let it be rooted in <hi>juſtice</hi> and eſtabliſhed in <hi>truth;</hi> or otherwiſe, the <hi>breath</hi> of the Lord will <hi>ſcatter</hi> it, and the <hi>wrath</hi> of God will ſoon <hi>deſtroy</hi> it; and inſtead of <hi>bleſſing,</hi> will, as <hi>Jacob</hi> ſaid, bring the <hi>curſe</hi> of God upon you and your Poſterity. And you might <hi>ſee</hi> if you had your eyes <hi>open,</hi> the great <hi>care</hi> of my <hi>L Duke,</hi> and the great <hi>pains</hi> and <hi>diligence</hi> of the Court of <hi>Claim,</hi> to ſearch out the <hi>truth</hi> of every cauſe, that the inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent ſhould not be made <hi>guilty,</hi> nor the nocent carry away the <hi>victory.</hi> And what <hi>more</hi> would you have done?</p>
            <p>Yet, as I ſaid before, they that have learned the <hi>way</hi> to be Rebels, do <hi>know</hi> the way to be rebellious ſtill.</p>
            <pb n="85" facs="tcp:100152:50"/>
            <p>But if they will needs charge our <hi>good King</hi> and the <hi>Duke's Grace</hi> for any fault, let them do it for their being <hi>too mercy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full</hi> and <hi>milde,</hi> in ſuffering them and others that are like them, to live, that had ſo <hi>juſtly</hi> deſerved to dye; and eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially if they would <hi>ſuffer them</hi> to enjoy the Lands of the <hi>Church,</hi> and the Poſſeſſions of them that are <hi>innocent.</hi>

            <p>And therefore all men ſhould take heed of committing this horrible ſin of <hi>injuſtice,</hi> either by doing wrong, or denying right unto others.</p>
            <p>And yet I am aſhamed to <hi>ſpeak</hi> it,
<note place="margin">The injuſtice of ſome Judges.</note> though I ſhall not be affraid to <hi>Write</hi> it, how <hi>gravely</hi> ſome Judges have ſate upon the feat of <hi>judgment</hi> to pronounce <hi>unrighteous</hi> judgments, and think to cover all their <hi>iniquity</hi> with the fig-leaves of the <hi>formalities</hi> of their Lawes to overthrow the <hi>reality</hi> of juſtice.</p>
            <p>Oh beloved, <hi>Monſtrum horrendum ingens eſt,</hi> it is a moſt horrible thing to have <hi>injuſtice done</hi> from the <hi>ſeat,</hi> and from the <hi>Miniſters</hi> of juſtice; when a man is <hi>apparently</hi> wronged, oppreſſed, and <hi>expulſed out of houſe and home,</hi> and ſhall with a deale of <hi>travel</hi> and a great deale of <hi>expences</hi> come to a <hi>Court of juſtice</hi> to be righted, and inſtead of being <hi>redreſſed,</hi> he ſhall ſee there <hi>ſeelus ſceleribus tectum,</hi> his former wrongs <hi>finely</hi> handled and <hi>loaded</hi> with far <hi>greater</hi> wrongs. Do you think that this is <hi>well pleaſing</hi> unto God, or that ſuch <hi>injuſtice</hi> ſhall eſcape <hi>unpuniſhed?</hi> no, no; for they ſhall finde that there is a God <hi>which judgeth the earth,</hi> and that his <hi>judgment</hi> will be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to <hi>truth,</hi> without <hi>partiality,</hi> either to <hi>Jew</hi> or <hi>Gentile,</hi> which here among men I ſee is not ſo.</p>
            <p>But as I read that <hi>Diogenes</hi> ſeeing ſome <hi>petty thieves</hi> led to the place of execution <hi>laughed exceedingly,</hi> and being demand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>why</hi> he laughed? he <hi>anſwered</hi> to ſee the <hi>great thieves</hi> lead the <hi>little thieves</hi> to the Gallowes: ſo if he ſhould ſee men <hi>forcibly expelled</hi> out of their poſſeſsions, and the forcible en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trers
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:100152:51"/>
               <hi>legally acquitted;</hi> or if he ſhould ſee the <hi>poor Iriſh Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks</hi> driven out of houſe and home, either becauſe they were <hi>Iriſh rebels</hi> which juſtly deſerved it, or becauſe they were <hi>Romiſh Catholicks,</hi> which ſhould not therefore be deſtroyed; and ſhould ſee the <hi>great Engliſh Sectaries</hi> (that had been <hi>great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er</hi> rebels) countenanced and <hi>magnified,</hi> and to injoy the <hi>others</hi> Lands and Livings: would he not <hi>laugh</hi> at this juſtice? which is juſt <hi>like that</hi> which we read of in <hi>l.</hi> 1. of <hi>Philip Commines</hi> when <hi>Charelois</hi> loſt the Feild, and his Captains, and their Troopers <hi>fled away,</hi> he gave the offices and <hi>places</hi> of them that fled <hi>ten leagues</hi> to thoſe that had fled <hi>twenty leagues</hi> beyond them.</p>
            <p>Therefore I ſay to you, whom <hi>God</hi> and the <hi>King</hi> have made <hi>Judges</hi> of theſe things for the <hi>ſettlement</hi> of this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome; As you have done hitherto, ſo ſtill <hi>ride on with your ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour</hi> and have <hi>no reſpect</hi> of <hi>Perſons,</hi> nor of <hi>Nation,</hi> nor of <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligien:</hi> but do that which is juſt <hi>and righteous in the ſight of God,</hi> and as God hath bleſt you and <hi>preſerved</hi> you hitherto, ſo he will ſtill <hi>bleſs</hi> you and <hi>preſerve you for ever more.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And for the preſervation of <hi>better juſtice</hi> then I ſee in <hi>many</hi> places, I ſhall ſpeak <hi>more</hi> of it in another place, and after <hi>ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther manner;</hi> for you may be ſure, that Kingdome ſhall never be <hi>happy,</hi> where oppreſsion is <hi>frequently</hi> uſed, and iniquity <hi>protected</hi> by <hi>injuſtice,</hi> and eſpecially by the <hi>Courts of Juſtice.</hi> And therefore to the end that true juſtice might be <hi>truly</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, I could wiſh the <hi>Parliament</hi> would make ſome Acts &amp; Lawes againſt <hi>many abuſes practiſed</hi> by ſome <hi>cunning Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yers</hi> in the very <hi>Courts</hi> of Juſtice;
<note place="margin">The abuſe of ſome cunning Lawyers in quaſhing of Indictments.</note> and eſpecially againſt the <hi>frequent and abuſive quaſhing of Indictments,</hi> which is a ſin of <hi>no ſlender</hi> malignity. For when a <hi>poor man</hi> far from the fountain is by <hi>vielence</hi> oppreſſed, and he <hi>indicts</hi> his oppreſſors, then preſently comes a <hi>Certiorari</hi> and removes it to the Kings Bench, and there the Lawyers are ſo <hi>skilfull</hi> in the tricks and quiddities of the Law and the Caſes of <hi>John A-Nokes</hi> and <hi>John A-Stiles,</hi> that they ſay there can <hi>hardly</hi> be <hi>any indictment</hi> framed, but they are able to finde a <hi>flaw</hi> to quaſh it, which I was told by great Lawyers. And what a <hi>wrong</hi> is this to his

               <hi>Majeſty</hi> in his fines? what an <hi>injury</hi> to the <hi>poor men</hi> that are oppreſſed, and what <hi>incouragement</hi> to all thoſe <hi>wicked</hi> men that are ſo <hi>ready</hi> to offer <hi>all violence</hi> unto their neighbours which are <hi>not able</hi> to indict the ſame offendors three or four times over, till they ſhall finde a man able to draw a <hi>fault<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs</hi> indictment.</p>
            <p>And if this be not a <hi>greivous greivance</hi> worthy to be <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſed,</hi> if you deſire the <hi>preſervation</hi> of juſtice, judge you.

            </p>
            <p>I will briefly anſwer as <hi>Samuel</hi> did unto the people,

And I deſired <hi>nothing</hi> but what I conceived to be the <hi>right</hi> of the Church, becauſe I know God loves not to be <hi>honoured</hi> with unjuſtly gotten goods.</p>
            <p>But now finding that as the Prophet ſaith, <hi>I have laboured in vain, and I have ſpent my ſtrength for nought;</hi> and ſeeing

            <p>
               <hi>Heliodorus</hi> was no ſooner entred into the <hi>treaſury,</hi> to take away the ſpoile, but there appeared to him a <hi>terrible man</hi> in compleat armour of gold, mounted upon a barbed horſe that ran <hi>very fiercely</hi> at the Kings Treaſurer, and trampled him un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der-foot; and withall, there appeared two other men of moſt

            <p>For ſo we read, that the Devil aſſailed ſome of the <hi>beſt Saints,</hi> as Saint <hi>Martin,</hi> Saint <hi>Bernard, Ignatius, Euſebius,</hi> and others; and if theſe things be done <hi>in a green tree,</hi> what ſhall be done <hi>in a withered,</hi> ſaith our Saviour?

               <hi>he hath hope in his death:</hi> and he knoweth not whom he needs to fear, becauſe he knoweth whom he hath believed: and when his body is weakeſt his faith is ſtrongeſt:
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:100152:55"/>and therefore with Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> he deſires to be diſſolved, and he longs for death, that he may be with him which was dead, and is alive, and liveth for evermore: and he is well conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that his body ſhall go to the grave, that his ſoul may go to glory: and that his fleſh ſhall ſleep in the duſt, that his ſpirit may rejoyce in heaven. And this is the ſtate of the godly man at the day of his death.</p>
            <p>And therefore, if men would feriouſly conſider this before they come to this, then certainly the fear of the moſt fearful death of the wicked, and the love of the moſt comfortable death of the godly, would make them to have ſome care of Godly lives, and to repent them of their wickedneſs.
